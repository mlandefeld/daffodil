# Container Component

The container component is a basic layout element that can be used to contain layouts or individual components to a fixed width.

There are three variants in the container component: `container--small`, `container--medium`, and `container--large`.

## Usage

```
<daff-container size="large">
    <!-- Content here -->
</daff-container> 
```
